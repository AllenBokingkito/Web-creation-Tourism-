            <div class="image-title">The Dumaguete Belfry is a historical tourist spot in Dumaguete city, right in the very centre of town. Its hard to miss, given its size, and is often surrounded by tourists, religious faithfuls, vendors and beggars. The Dumaguete Belfry has stood since the 1760s, serving as a watchtower to look out for pirates and invaders. Now, with pirates no longer a threat, the belfry is a religious site and a place to pay respects.
